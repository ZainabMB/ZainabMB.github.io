# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Getting unexpected tickets is very frustrating for drivers. Journey links is an app created to help drivers find 
 ANPR cameras on their journeys to remind them to be cautious because they are being watched.

### Business benefits
Journey links will benefit: 
*The driver: by showing them they need to be cautious and helping them avoid tickets 
*All Road users: by reducing accidents as the drivers are more cautious 
*Law enforcement: by making their jobs easier 

### Options Considered
Google maps offers something similar and could be an alternative, but t only gives notifications rather than showing those cameras. 

### Expected Risks
It could aid drivers to break rules when they know they are not being watched 

## Project Scope
Actor: The actor in this app is the driver
Data source: B

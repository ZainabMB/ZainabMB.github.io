# Project Proposal
Community toilets: Finding community toilets for users
## Business Case

### Problem statement
Trying to find the nearest community toilets may sometimes be difficult to find when people are not somewhere that they are very familiar of. Community toilets is an app designed for users to find community toilets when in necessary conditions.

### Business benefits
Community toilets will benefit: 
<li>The user: by helping them find community toilets in necessary conditions</li>
<li>Community Improvement: By accessing to community toilets contributes to overall community well-being and development.</li>
<li>Environmental Benefits: By encouraging the use of designated toilets, it helps reduce pollution and keeps public spaces cleaner.</li>

### Options Considered
Toilet Finder app offers users to find public toilets. Unlike Toilet Finder app, Community Toilets gives access to users to find community toilets.
### Expected Risks
It may not always be useful since it only shows community toilets which are only located near housing areas.
## Project Scope
